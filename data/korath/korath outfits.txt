	description "The Kor Metri were developing a new capital ship, the Model 1024, to counter a vast, new, battleship the Kor Sestor were preparing. Even Stellar-Class steering wasn't enough to turn the great beast. This steering system incorporates anti-gravity to accelerate the propelled plasma far beyond what the engine can manage on its own. The engine was first tested on a Model 256; the ship spun so fast its mines flew out of their racks and hit the hull."
	description "Although the Model 1024 was never completed, its engines still see service on Korath Exile world-ships. The technology behind them has become the basis for the Banisher and Expeller."
	
	# Physics lesson: the more mass you move to the outer part of a turning object,
	# the higher its moment of inertia becomes, and hence the harder it is to turn.
	# The Model 512 has the highest moment of inertia possible since it's a circle.
	# Enlarging the design (Model 1024) would make that worse. Thus the need for
	# better steering.

	description "This rifle is commonplace among the Korath, predating the creation of the Repeater by at least two centuries. As it uses superheated plasma instead of lasers, the rifle is slow to fire and can sometimes burn its user's hands if they aren't careful. It makes up for these setbacks by guaranteeing that those hit won't live long enough to fire back."
