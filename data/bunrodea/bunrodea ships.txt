	description "The Tekkan is the one ship in the Bunrodean arsenal that favors turrets over forward facing guns. This allows the small and fast vessel to act as the primary means of anti-missile defense for larger Bunrodean ships that are lacking in turret mounts compared to their guns. Tekkans are also able to take advantage of the rarely used but powerful Locust Turrets, packing a considerable amount of damage into a small ship."

	description "The Kunai is the smallest of the Bunrodea's gunships, warships which focus heavily on the power of their forward-facing guns.

Some Chigiriki also double as missile platforms, raining down walls of missiles so thick that they can blot out the nearest star."
