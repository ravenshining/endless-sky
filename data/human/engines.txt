This can be very useful for dodging missiles or briefly escaping from faster opponents, but you must be careful to avoid using up so much fuel that you do not have enough left for hyperspace travel."

# Note on Lateral Thrusters: My initial values here are to have each set of lateral thrusters be based on the thruster of the same "rank".
# So the tiny lateral has values equivalent to about 90% of a tiny thruster. The small lateral thruster is roughly 80% of a small thruster, etc.
# This continues by 10% increments down to the Huge lateral thrusters that are equivalent of 50% of the huge thrusters.
# This percentage is applied equally to mass, outfit space, engine capacity, lateral thrust, lateral thrusting energy, and lateral thrusting heat.

# Note on Lateral Thrusters: My initial values here are to have each set of lateral thrusters be based on the thruster of the same "rank".
# So the tiny lateral has values equivalent to about 90% of a tiny thruster. The small lateral thruster is roughly 80% of a small thruster, etc.
# This continues by 10% increments down to the Huge lateral thrusters that are equivalent of 50% of the huge thrusters.
# This percentage is applied equally to mass, outfit space, engine capacity, lateral thrust, lateral thrusting energy, and lateral thrusting heat.

	description "	Because a reverse thruster must be facing forwards, it must be installed in the weapon section of your ship instead of the engine section."

	description "Atomic engines are considered by many to be Deep Sky's crowning achievement. Although they are so expensive that relatively few of them are in use, there are few captains who do not dream of one day installing a set of them."


# Note on Lateral Thrusters: My initial values here are to have each set of lateral thrusters be based on the thruster of the same "rank".
# So the tiny lateral has values equivalent to about 90% of a tiny thruster. The small lateral thruster is roughly 80% of a small thruster, etc.
# This continues by 10% increments down to the Huge lateral thrusters that are equivalent of 50% of the huge thrusters.
# This percentage is applied equally to mass, outfit space, engine capacity, lateral thrust, lateral thrusting energy, and lateral thrusting heat.
