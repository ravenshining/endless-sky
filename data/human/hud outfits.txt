	description "This innocuous device is so compact as to barely count as an outfit at all. Some pilots find it useful to know what their ship's current mass is while in-flight, and this little display adds that information to their Heads Up Display."

	description "This innocuous device is so compact as to barely count as an outfit at all. Its sole purpose is to allow pilots to customize their heads-up display to provide their flight computer's current estimate of the amount of fuel they need to make a hyperjump."

	description "This innocuous device is so compact as to barely count as an outfit at all. Its sole purpose is to allow pilots to customize their heads-up display so that their fuel bar is segmented into sections representing a single hyperdrive jump."
	description "	Just like the HUD display, the amount of fuel represented by each segment of the bar is automatically calculated in flight, and while landed it uses the ship's fully outfitted but otherwise empty mass. Given how standardized hyperdrives are, this is the default segmentation most ships use, and it will override other fuel segmentation customizations. Due to limitations of the display, if you have 31 or more hyper jumps worth of fuel, the display will show as a solid bar."

	description "This innocuous device is so compact as to barely count as an outfit at all. Its sole purpose is to allow pilots to customize their heads-up display so that their fuel bar is segmented into sections where each full section is exactly the amount of fuel specified. It will be overridden by any other fuel display segmentation that is present; and due to display limitations, it will show a solid bar if 31 or more full fuel segments would be called for."
